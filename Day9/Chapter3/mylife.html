        <h1>My Name Is Ryan Lindsey</h1><br>
        <h2>This is my childhood</h2><br>
        <p>I came into the world February 15, 1994, with humble beginnings in a working class family. I grew up in relatively small town, next
            to an Air Force base. My grandfather was in for 20 years, so they moved around a lot. As a kid, my mother was very lax, so I spent
            most of my days exploring nature, at the public swimming pool, watching animal planet, and reading math books at the library
            for fun. I wasn't like most of the kids that I grew up with, I had a deep curiosity and drive to understand what I didn't understand
            (mostly likely because my mother never taught me how to think.)
        </p>
        <h2>This is my adult life</h2>
        <p>As I grew up, I experience incredible highs and lows in my life, searching for existential meaning while
            trying to hold it all together. After I graduated college in 2017 with my degree in Toxicology, I decided to
            spend some time finding myself, so I left everything behind and moved to Austin, TX. Here found what it meant to truly
            love and appreciate yourself. If you're stripped of everything in life, the last thing you have is your relationship to
            your Self. I moved to Memphis, TN, and worked a soul crushing job in a laboratory for 2.5 years, meanwhile coordinating my plans to completely
            turn my life around. That resulted in taking a leap of faith, and becoming the first in my immediate family
            to get a graduate degree, and even further in a field like computer science. I'm now a 26 year old 
            student at MIU, loving every moment of my life and what I do.
