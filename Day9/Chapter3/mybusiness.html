        <h1>My Business Vision</h1><br>
        <p>My dream is to connect the gap between public health and human wellbeing with
            modern technology. While technology and wellbeing seem to be at odds with one another,
            our advances in deep learning, precision robotics, and data analytics will spur
            the growth of a new paradigm for how we target areas like humanitarian relief,
            personalized medicine, biomedical research, and socioeconomic reform. 
        </p><br>
        <p>My vision is one of an organization where we start putting time and effort into using
            artificial intelligence for more than self driving cars and voice recognition, but to solve
            problems in genomics and personalized medicine, fields in which advancement can take decades.
            Google has already shown with DeepMind that we can harness these tools to tackle these
            areas with relative ease. If we intentionally moved our resources towards finding
            better solutions in these areas, I believe that our world would be a happier place.
